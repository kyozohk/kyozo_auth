/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Not applicable in this simple user-ownership model, as the path itself defines ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All user data is considered private and stored under the user's unique path.
